# SpinTheCube

This project is trying to implement an 3D cube spinning example and demonstrate the enhancement of Arm performance libraries. https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Performance%20Libraries
The main function of the project SpinTheCubeInGDI is to the spinning of a 3D cube using the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) in a Windows environment. 
The project involves creating a window application that renders a 3D cube and applies rotation transformations to it, making it appear as if the cube is spinning.

The key components of the project include:

* 3D Cube Representation: The code defines the vertices (corners) of a cube in 3D space. These vertices are stored in a data structure.

* Projection: It then transforms these 3D coordinates into 2D screen coordinates. This involves:
  * Perspective Projection: The code simulates perspective, making objects appear smaller as they get farther away.
  * Screen Transformation: It maps the 3D world coordinates onto the 2D window space.

* Rotation: The cube is animated by applying rotation transformations to its vertices. The code likely uses:
  * Rotation Matrices: Standard matrix operations are used to rotate the cube around its X, Y, and Z axes.
  * Incremental Rotation: The rotation angles are changed slightly in each frame of the animation to create a smooth spinning effect.

* GDI Rendering: The core rendering is done using GDI functions like:
  * GetDC(): To obtain a device context to draw on.
  * MoveToEx() and LineTo(): To draw the edges of the cube as lines on the screen.
  * ReleaseDC(): To release the device context after drawing.

* Animation Loop: The project includes a simple animation loop that:
  * Clears the screen.
  * Updates the cube's rotation angles.
  * Transforms the cube's vertices into 2D coordinates.
  * Draws the projected lines of the cube on the screen.
  * Repeats this process in a loop to create the animation.
