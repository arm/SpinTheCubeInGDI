# SpinTheCube

This project is trying to implement an 3D cube spinning example and demonstrate the enhancement of Arm performance libraries. https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Performance%20Libraries
The main function of the project SpinTheCubeInGDI is to the spinning of a 3D cube using the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) in a Windows environment. 
The project involves creating a window application that renders a 3D cube and applies rotation transformations to it, making it appear as if the cube is spinning.

The key components of the project include:

* Window Creation: The application creates a window using the Windows API, which serves as the canvas for rendering the 3D cube.
* 3D Cube Definition: The cube is defined by its vertices in a 3D space. These vertices are stored in a data structure and are used to draw the cube.
* Rotation Matrix: A rotation matrix is used to apply rotation transformations to the cube's vertices. This matrix is updated continuously to create the spinning effect.
* Rendering Loop: The application runs a loop that continuously updates the rotation angle and redraws the cube with the new rotated vertices. This loop ensures that the cube appears to be spinning smoothly.
* GDI Drawing: The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) functions are used to draw the cube on the window. This includes drawing lines between the vertices to form the edges of the cube.
The project is written in C++ and utilizes the Windows API for window management and GDI for rendering the graphics. The main file, SpinTheCubeInGDI.cpp, contains the core logic for creating the window, defining the cube, applying the rotation, and rendering the cube on the screen.
